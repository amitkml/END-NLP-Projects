## Business Problem
- Download the StanfordSentimentAnalysis Dataset from this [link](http://nlp.stanford.edu/~socherr/stanfordSentimentTreebank.zip)
- Use "datasetSentences.txt" and "sentiment_labels.txt" files from the zip you just downloaded as your dataset. 
- This dataset contains just over 10,000 pieces of Stanford data from HTML files of Rotten Tomatoes. 
- The sentiments are rated between 1 and 25, where one is the most negative and 25 is the most positive.
- Train your model and try and achieve 60%+ accuracy.
