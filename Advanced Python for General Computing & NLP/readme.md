This repo contains my solution for the following assignments. Essentially, we have used list, filter, reduce, listcomprehension and lambda function logic of python.

- Write a function using only list filter lambda that can tell whether a number is a Fibonacci number or not. You can use a pre-calculated list/dict to store fab numbers till 10000 
- Using list comprehension (and zip/lambda/etc if required) write five different expressions that: 
    - add 2 iterables a and b such that a is even and b is odd
    - strips every vowel from a string provided (tsai>>t s)
    - acts like a ReLU function for a 1D array
    - acts like a sigmoid function for a 1D array
    - takes a small character string and shifts all characters by 5 (handle boundary conditions) tsai>>yxfn
- A list comprehension expression that takes a ~200 word paragraph (write your own paragraph to check), and checks whether it has any of the swear words mentioned in https://github.com/RobertJGabriel/Google-profanity-words/blob/master/list.txt
- Using reduce functions: PTS:100
    - add only even numbers in a list
    - find the biggest character in a string (printable ascii characters)
    - adds every 3rd number in a list
- Using randint, random.choice and list comprehensions, write an expression that generates 15 random KADDAADDDD number plates, where KA is fixed, D stands for a digit, and A stands for Capital alphabets. 10<<DD<<99 & 1000<<DDDD<<9999
- Write the above again from scratch where KA can be changed to DL, and 1000/9999 ranges can be provided.
